<h1>Computer Aided Designs</h1>

<ul>
	<li>I came to know about Sketch Up when I had to mentor into TinkerFest in which students made designs in sketchup and printed it.</li>
	<li>I had to learn 3D printing and Laser Cutting for my flute project so I started with Autocad </li>
	<li>I took membership of Fablab and started working over there. Rudrapal taught me the basics and asked me to start with simple drawing. Then he told me to proceed with making islamic desgns which I thought was little difficult.</li>

	</ul>

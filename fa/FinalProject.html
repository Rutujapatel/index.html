	<h1>Auto Flute</h1>

		<h3>Why I choose this project</h3>
		<p>I was in my second semistor of engineering when I visited Fablab for first time. I was glad after visiting because that was the environment I had wished to work in my school days. As Dhruv sir was student of Fablab I used to visit fablab frequently. One day at CEPT I was talking to sir about my hobby of playing flute, he suggested me to do a project of making an automatic flute playing machine. I have been working on this project since last 3 months. I searched on google if any machine playing flute automatically is made or not and came to know about various machines that were made to play flute automatically. After that I came to the conclution of upgrading the flute machine from complex to more simpler one. I have given below the sketches I made and also information of automatic flute machines which are already made. </p>

		<h3>Starting with the project</h3>
		<img src="flutesketch.jpg" alt="flutesketch" width="1000" height="500" align="centr">
		<p>This is the rough sketch I have made. Following are the components which I have used in my project:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>servo motor</li>
			<li>Arduino</li>
			<li>Blower Nozel</li>
			<li>Pressure Controller</li>
		</ol>	
		<p>In this the servo motors will control the holes of flute and I heve taken Arduino Mega to control servo motor. The servo will react according to the tune given. </p>
		<p>The Blower Nozel and Pressure controller are yet to design.</p>

		<h3>What is flute</h3>
		<img src="bansuri.jpg"  alt="bansuri" width="1000" height="500" align="centre">
		<p>A wind instrument made from a tube with holes that are stopped by the fingers or keys, held vertically or horizontally (in which case it is also called a transverse flute ) so that the player's breath strikes a narrow edge. The modern orchestral form is a transverse flute, typically made of metal, with an elaborate set of keys.</p>
		<h3>How to start playing flute</h3>
		<p>Playing flute is very easy you only need to understand the sargam(notes) which are played on holes. The sargam are SA, RE GA, MA, PA, DHA, NI, SA. In the figure given below the notes played on the particular holes are given. The black coloured holes are to be covered with hands. Try ypurself and start playing.</p>
		<img src="bansurinotes.jpg" alt="bansurinotes" width="1000" height="700" align="centre">
		<p>There is Physics behing the sweet melody of flute. I have refered <a href="http://astro.pas.rochester.edu/~aquillen/phy103/Labs/FluteLab.pdf">Flute Lab</a> for this project.</p>
		<h3>Why I choose this project</h3>
		<p>I was in my second semistor of engineering when I visited Fablab for first time. I was glad after visiting because that was the environment I had wished to work in my school days. As Dhruv sir was student of Fablab I used to visit fablab frequently. One day at CEPT I was talking to sir about my hobby of playing flute, he suggested me to do a project of making an automatic flute playing machine. I have been working on this project since last 3 months. I searched on google if any machine playing flute automatically is made or not and came to know about various machines that were made to play flute automatically. After that I came to the conclution of upgrading the flute machine from complex to more simpler one. I have given below the sketches I made and also information of automatic flute machines which are already made. </p>

		<h3>Starting with the project</h3>
		<img src="flutesketch.jpg" alt="flutesketch" width="1000" height="500" align="centre">
		<p>This is the rough sketch I have made. Following are the components which I have used in my project:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>servo motor</li>
			<li>Arduino</li>
			<li>Blower Nozel</li>
			<li>Pressure Controller</li>
		</ol>	
		<p>In this, the servo motors will control the holes of flute and I heve taken Arduino Mega to control servo motor. The servo will react according to the tune given. Even the nozel with the blower will react according to the pressure given. As in Indian flute half covered hole is also a svara so will have to adjust the servos accordingly. Indian flute is little different than the flute used in other countries so this will be a total different project and  this will be first automatic Indian flute. </p>
		<p>The Blower Nozel and Pressure controller are yet to design properly. I am Going to 3D print the blower and the stand for flute.</p>
